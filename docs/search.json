    "text": "Cash rate forecasts\nThe figure below presents monthly cash rate series starting from January 2022 together with the forecasts reported as the forecast mean and the 68% forecasting intervals. The forecasts clearly follow the upwards trend in cash rate value up to June 2023 that is followed by a stabilisation at the level between 3.9-4 percent. The forecast intervals are quite vide and indicate a likely range between 3.3 and 4.5% in June 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below makes the numerical values presented in the figure accessible.\n\n\n\nCash rate forecasts\n\n\n\nforecast\nlower\nupper\n\n\n\n\nNov 2022\n2.73\n2.63\n2.83\n\n\nDec 2022\n2.97\n2.80\n3.14\n\n\nJan 2023\n3.19\n2.96\n3.43\n\n\nFeb 2023\n3.40\n3.09\n3.71\n\n\nMar 2023\n3.63\n3.24\n4.02\n\n\nApr 2023\n3.79\n3.33\n4.25\n\n\nMay 2023\n3.86\n3.34\n4.38\n\n\nJun 2023\n3.88\n3.30\n4.47\n\n\nJul 2023\n3.90\n3.26\n4.54\n\n\nAug 2023\n3.92\n3.23\n4.62\n\n\nSep 2023\n3.96\n3.21\n4.71\n\n\nOct 2023\n3.98\n3.19\n4.78"

By that time, the cash rate will nearly surely be higher than 3.6%, will most likely reach 4%, and is unlikely to exceed 4.4%. This would mean that the interest rates might get to the levels from early 2012.\n\nBy how much do you think the RBA will change the cash rate in the next meeting?\n\n50 basis points\n\nBy how much do you think the RBA should change the cash rate in the next meeting?\n\n50 basis points\n\nAt what level do you think the cash rate will peak?\n\n4.1%\n\nWhen do you think the cash rate will peak?\n\nJune 2023"

    "text": "Forecasting system\nThe forecasting system was formed for a series of eight interest rates, bond yields at different maturities, downloaded from RBA’s website using an R package readrba. The monthly data spanning the period starting in January 1995 and finishing in October 2022 is plotted below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese series are used to estimate twelve Vector Error Correction models and to forecast the cash rate one year ahead using an R package vars. The twelve models differ by the series used for estimation, lag order, and whether a dummy variable was used. Six of these models used all eight variables and six only five including cash rate and yields at maturity from 2 to 10 years. The lag order used were 3, 5, and 7. The dummy variable takes the value of zero for all periods, except for the last six in the sample periods to accommodate for the recent interest rate hikes. The forecasts for the six models with the dummy variable are based on a hypothesised scenario of likely increases and used value one for the dummy at all forecast horizons. The forecasts from the twelve models were pooled using equal weights."
